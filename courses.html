    <p class="text-center">
    The department houses ten academic laboratories under various verticals including Structural Engineering, Water Resource Engineering, Geotechnical Engineering and Advance Material Testing and also has one research laboratory as Advanced Concrete Research and Innovation Center (ACRIC) which is a nexus for improving the performance of concrete by infusing with ingenious materials and industrial waste and thereby decreasing the overall cement utility. The research center incorporates green building initiatives and reduction of drudgery by harnessing the salvaged resources from industrial and residential detritus.

In order to make teaching effective and interesting, the students are nurtured with a variety of learning activities including and not restricted to class room teaching, presentations, video lectures, MOOC courses, minor / honours courses, experiential learning (ExL) and online courses by faculty in the institute and across the globe.

The students are encouraged to learn advanced computing technologies to increase their core competency in the ever-growing market scenario as a complimentary technology for the core engineering knowledge. Also, advanced research software like Rivet, StaadPro etc., is taught in college premises by inviting experts from industries to impart their knowledge. The students are supported to go for full semester internships across the globe to various partner institutes to improve their prospects post their completion of graduate degree.
